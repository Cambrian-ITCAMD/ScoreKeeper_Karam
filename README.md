# Score Keeper

Creates a score keeping app using the Android Studio project. It is based on following aspects:
- An appropriate layout
- Two team names (TextView)
- Two scores (TextView)
- Buttons to increase and decrease the scores
  * Two Buttons with a way to determine which team is currently scoring (Switch or ToggleButton)
  * An amount to change the score by (RadioButtons or Spinner)

- There must be at least two scoring options
- The scores can be any values you choose. Here is some inspiration but feel free to use your own scores:
  * American Football: 1, 2, 3, 6
  * Basketball: 1, 2, 3
  * Freestyle Wrestling: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  * Cricket: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
  * Your own game that you make up your own scores; 1, 50, 99
  * Anything else you feel will be important to include

- For this lab the buttons do not need to do anything. This is only a layout
